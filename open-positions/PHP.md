### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. Now we're live in 12 countries across Asia-Pacific.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $4.5m USD in [last funding](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/hotelquickly-raises-4-5-million-to-double-down-on-last-minute-hotel-booking-in-asia-pacific/). That makes it $5.6M in total. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

### About you

You've built several projects and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Hopefully you'll have some published code (in any language, maybe on GitHub?) that we can take a look at.

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.

You want to be a part of a team creating a world-class application and creatively contribute to ongoing development.

### Why?

We believe people can and should experience last-minute traveling because all those spontaneous moments enrich our lives.

Therefore, we are serving travellers with a world-class mobile product that makes last-minute hotel booking fast and rewarding.

Do you want to help us build this product?

### The job and the challenges

We expect you to take ownership of some of our internal projects (we have dozens of git repositories at the moment). That means you should be

* watching trends and best practices in PHP development
* reading blogs and compiling ideas how to improve our Backend, Extranet and Frontend
* going for meetups in Bangkok discussing some of the recent challenges and how to handle them
* getting feedback about the system from our staff and making sure it's implemented
* able to quicky implement new things requested by business / sales
* able to work in a team with other Backend developers

On a more technical note, you need to know how to handle the entire software development life cycle, end to end, including working with

* some PHP framework ([Nette framework](http://nette.org), [Symphony 2](http://symfony.com/), [Laravel](http://laravel.com/))
* SQL + ORM database model ([Doctrine2](http://www.doctrine-project.org/))
* large database (we have 200+ tables in the main project)
* NoSQL database (we use both MongoDB and Redis for some internal Backend projects)
* XML (some of the services we are connected to use XML, unfortunately)
* JSON (used by most of the services we are connected to)
* cache (we use Memcache and Redis)
* templating system
* Javascript (do you know JQuery? Good. Do you work with AngularJS? Great. CasperJS? Hapi? No? You could with us ...)
* CSS frameworks (we use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/))
* OOP (pretty obvious, just to make sure you know it)
* version control repositories (preferably ```git```)

### Working environment

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke. 27" screens and ergonomic chairs.

Our working hours are typically 10am-8pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

We've got lots of fun at the office, check out what people say in the video below:

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need. To really (I mean *REALLY*) good candidates we can offer equity.

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).
