### About us

[HotelQuickly](http://www.hotelquickly.com) is the #1 mobile app for same-day hotel booking in Asia-Pacific with great last-minute discounts. Our company was set up by experienced [international team](http://www.hotelquickly.com/about-us) comprising of serial entrepreneurs and investors. We launched across Asia in March 2013 with teams in Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia. Now we're live in 12 countries across Asia-Pacific.

Recently we were featured on TechCrunch, CBS, NBC, e27, TechInAsia, TheNextWeb, Yahoo, Tnooz and [zillions of others](http://www.hotelquickly.com/press).

Oh, and we raised $4.5m USD in [last funding](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/09/hotelquickly-raises-4-5-million-to-double-down-on-last-minute-hotel-booking-in-asia-pacific/). That makes it $5.6M in total. So let's help us make this company HUGE!

### Why?

We believe people can and should experience last-minute traveling because spontaneous moments enrich life.

Therefore, we are serving travellers with a mobile product that makes last-minute hotel booking fast and rewarding.

### About you

You've worked on different BI projects and our initial assignments during the [interview process](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#hiring-process) will be a walk in a park for you ;-)

Honestly, we don't really care about your level of formal education, math skill, and so on. We want to see that you know the shit.

### The job and the challenges

We expect you to know how to handle the entire BI development life cycle, start to end, meaning:

* working with large data sets
* aggregating data in a data warehouse
* creating ETLs
* validating and testing the data
* preparing data export layer for a data analyst or data scientist
* working with MySQL or Oracle procedures
* optimising SQL queries

### Location

You'll be working in our office in Bangkok, directly with all the other engineers and the tech co-founder. We have a beautiful office here full of snacks and Coke.

See some photos [in our gallery](https://plus.google.com/photos/100392005626903871747/albums/6014406468923735649).

Our working hours are typically 10am-7pm, but it's pretty flexible. Some of us start early morning (8am), some of us start later and work until midnight.

### Communication

We communicate over HipChat. Sometimes even when we sit next to each other ;-) to not disturb each other when we're *in the zone.* In HipChat, each topic or project has its own room and we use mentions to notify when there's something important. Jim is also posting there some funny *.gif* images.

### Compensation

* **Salary** - We're still small but we recognise that we need to pay well to get the talent we need.
* **Equity** - To really good candidates we can offer stock options. Yay!

But we offer much more to make you happy - check the [compensation packages](https://github.com/HotelQuickly/WeAreHiring/blob/master/README.md#compensation--perks).
